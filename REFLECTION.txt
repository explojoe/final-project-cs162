Joshua Wentzel's winter 2018 CS162 REFLECTIOn.txt

I've just now started work on the final project.
I plan to take most of Lab-9's code and use it for the maze system in this project.
I need to change a few names, like explorer should become IntrepidStudent.

I spent 30 minutes discovering that I had written "#define struct union"
in my main.cpp just to see how destructive it was, but I forgot about it.

Right now I'm working on upcasting maze_person derived classes to use maze_person
functions. Stack Overflow is a great resource for this.

Decided to just use a bunch of virtual functions.

I think there's a circular dependency in here somewhere.

discovered a "#define class union" in one of my headers.
My friends like to meme apparently.

I threw in a fun little addition: when you collect a programming skill,
it says you discovered one of several different CS skills related to this class.

I've finished! The code works and it looks and feels really good.

Now fixing codestyle and adding comments everywhere.

Clarifications:
	nowhere does it say TAs cannot occupy the same space, so they can in this program.
	There is a suprising amount of input error checking.
